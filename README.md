# ycalendar

This library is to show a calendar which has some functionalities, like schedule.
This project is under the MIT-license.

If you want to use this library, you just put the sub-directory "ycalendar" into your project.

I recomend you [ycalendar2](https://github.com/Yor-Jihons/ycalendar2), instead of this library.

See also [here](./ycalendar/README.md).
